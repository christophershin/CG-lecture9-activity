Vertex Fragment Shader:

I added a tile-based texture so that the Vertex Fragment can make it look more tiled on one side or on both sides. This can be used to create scales on some creature or rooftop tiles. 



Simple Shadow:

This shader can be used for large buildings or formations. 

Shadow with texture:

Even though the shadow with texture doesn't really work as intended, I think this can be utilized as some kind of flashlight or lamppost shining some light on the ground. 

Glass:

Though the glass doesn't work as intended, I feel like this can be used for buildings to add character and personality. 


Water:

The water shader makes the texture move by using a sin wave. This is a viable tool for water effects as well as flags. 


water Scrolling:

This water scrolling effect is animated to scroll from one side to the other. This could be used to have screens in-game to scroll through different images.
